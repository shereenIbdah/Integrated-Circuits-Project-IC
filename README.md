Design 8-bit CAM using 9T SRAM for Digital Integrated Design
## OverView
The primary objective of this project is to develop
an 8-bit Content Addressable Memory (CAM) using a 9T SRAM
configuration in the Electric Generic 14nm CMOS Library. The
design implementation focuses on achieving maximum power
savings and minimizing the area required for the CAM cell,
specifically during the write operation within the 14nm process
technology. This design approach aims to strike a balance
between low power consumption and low delay, optimizing
the performance of the CAM. The key aspects of this project
include the utilization of 9T SRAM, CAM cell design, low
power considerations, XOR operation, and efficient read and
write operations.
